# LQR-MATLAB
Linear Quadratic Regulator using MATLAB.

The codes are based on my lecture note on LQR titled A NOTE ON LINEAR QUADRATIC REGULATOR AND KALMAN FILTER. 
For a better understanding of the codes and the theory of LQR, the note can be refered. The link for accessing the note is given below:
